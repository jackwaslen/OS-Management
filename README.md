 ## Operating System Management with Linux/Unix/POSIX ðŸš€ ##
This is some work I've done with Operating Systems. I use C in combination with POSIX to coordinate Linux/Unix System Calls to effectively manage and integrate the resources of an operating system. In this repository I...
   * Create shared memory objects using POSIX and use child/parent processes to optimize solutions to a complex problem.
   * Create a program accessible via command line, where users can allocate and decallocate memory, implementing data structures to allow us to use compaction/first-fit allocation.
   * Manage thread resource counts to control the creation/deletion of threads, enabling us to safely optimize system resources.
   * Analyze thread arrival, burst, turn-around and waiting times based on inputted thread schedules.
